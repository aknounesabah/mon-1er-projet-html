    <h1>virtualization</h1>
      <div>
        <p>In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual(rather than actual) version of something</p>
        <p>   this includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.</p>

          <h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
            <h3>1 Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level</h3>
            <p>Every machine has an instruction set .This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware.
Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.</p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>2 Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level</h3>
            <p>In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S.,application suites, networking systems, etc.</p>
            <p>* In cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.</p>
            <p>* So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware. </p>
